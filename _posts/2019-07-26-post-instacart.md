You can know a lot about a person by the way they shop. That's what Instacart thinks, anyway. They've released a [public dataset](https://tech.instacart.com/3-million-instacart-orders-open-sourced-d40d29ead6f2) with over 3 million grocery orders.

My objective was to replicate an [analysis](https://tech.instacart.com/3-million-instacart-orders-open-sourced-d40d29ead6f2) Instacart did to find out which products users tend to order the earliest and latest in the day. I'll write more detail later, but the main takeaway was that when night falls, **people buy ice cream**. 

Here is how the earliest and latest purchases stacked up:
