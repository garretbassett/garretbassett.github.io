Hi! I'm Garret. I'm learning to work with data, and hoping to leverage those skills to uncover new insights about the world around me.

Here's a few questions that are on my mind:
- How can we help young people to better identify their intellectual strengths and interests?
- What are the distinct types of work being done at a typical firm, and what is the optimal mix?
- What can data tell us about the history of music, and how can machine learning change its future?
- Why isn't internet access treated as a utility, and what would be possible if it was?
- How can we leverage data to improve outcomes in healthcare and medicine?

Hopefully someday my work speaks for itself.
