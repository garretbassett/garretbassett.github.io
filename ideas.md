# Data Storytelling Ideas

## You

**What do you care about?**

- **Organizational psychology**. What different types of work are there? What skills do different jobs employ?
How can people know whether they are good at something?
- **User behavior**. Since I work in product strategy at a tech company, working on a project that closely resembles
something I might do at work could be a great addition to my portfolio.

**What do you know about?**

Not much, but I'm willing to learn.

**What decisions do you face?**

Career, time management, philosophy / belief

## Organizational Psychology

### X is really non-X

**What misconceptions do people have about your topic?**
Based on my limited experience, there tends to be some discrepancy between the skills and responsibilities articulated
in a job description, and what the job actually is. If there were some kind of universal taxonomy, or even a domain-specific
one, that identified the different types of work and the relevant skills, that could potentially help job seekers better
gauge their likelihood to succeed in a given role.

### Data

**How could you search for data about your topic?**

Potential data sources include:
- **Job websites**. LinkedIn, Glassdoor, Indeed, etc. My objective here would be to analyze job descriptions to get
a sense for the frequency of certain skills or responsibilities.
- **Government employment data**. Example would be BLS. I've worked with this data before and wasn't super impressed,
but will give it another shot.
- **Academic studies**. Existing literature on this topic could give me data to use as a starting point, and any skills taxonomy I find could serve as a baseline for classification.
